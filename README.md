# Customer-Segmentation-K-Means-Analysis
This project leverages unsupervised machine learning (K-Means) to segment customers based on demographic and behavioral data (Age, Income, Spending Score). By identifying distinct customer groups, businesses can tailor marketing strategies, optimize resource allocation, and enhance customer engagement.


# Customer Segmentation using K-Means Clustering  

## 📌 Project Description  
This project performs **customer segmentation** using **K-Means clustering** on a dataset containing customer attributes such as age, income, and spending habits. The goal is to identify distinct customer groups for targeted marketing strategies.  

### **Key Steps**  
1. **Data Exploration** – Understanding dataset structure and statistics.  
2. **Data Visualization** – Visualizing distributions and relationships.  
3. **K-Means Clustering** – Determining optimal clusters using the **Elbow Method**.  
4. **Cluster Analysis** – Interpreting customer segments for business insights.

## 🔍 Key Conclusions from Clustering  

### **Identified Customer Segments**  

1. **Young Professionals (Ages 18–30, High Income, Low Spending)**  
   - Financially stable but cautious spenders.  
   - Best targeted with savings plans and investment products.  

2. **Middle-Aged Balancers (Ages 30–45, Moderate Income & Spending)**  
   - Steady spenders; respond well to loyalty programs.  

3. **Older Spenders (Ages 50–65, Low Income, High Spending)**  
   - Likely retirees spending on healthcare or leisure.  
   - Discounts on healthcare/travel may appeal to them.  

4. **Affluent Big Spenders (Ages 30–50, High Income & Spending)**  
   - Ideal for luxury brands and VIP offers.  

5. **Budget-Conscious Youth (Ages 18–35, Low Income & Spending)**  
   - Students or early-career individuals.  
   - Discounts and flexible payment options work best.  

6. **Wealthy High Discretionary Spenders (All Ages, High Income & Spending)**
